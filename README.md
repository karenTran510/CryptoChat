####Motivation
Instant online messaging is one of the most popular form of communication in our current time, but it’s hard to tell how secure your online conversations are kept. An online secure channel where strangers can’t eavesdrop on your conversation, and where your conversation history is deleted after the chat session ends, are the best ways for ensuring the privacy of your online conversations. 

####Description
Cryptochat is for chatting with people on a secure channel, where the messages you pass to each other will not be eavesdropped by other people, and won’t be saved after the chat session has ended. Users of Sec-chat can build secret chat room, and invite other users to join in the conversation. The user is required to create a login account. The user can feel safe that his or her login information is safe from adversary attacks, and that his or her conversations cannot be viewed or copied by an unauthorized user on the web.  

####Implementation
Cryptochat will be compatible on any web browser (Chrome, FireFox, etc.), and will be hosted on a private web server. The software languages we’ll be using to implement our system are Javascript, HTML, CSS, JSON, PHP, and encryption libraries.

####Goals
```
-No messages saved on server
-Secure and unique login
-Encrypted messages
-Authorized access for one-to-one chat rooms
```
